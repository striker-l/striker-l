Hi, I'm @striker-l! It's nice to meet you. 

I manage projects and people in the general Customer Service and Technical Support zone to help everyone get what they need. ðŸŽ‰

My goals right now are to get better at coding and build some experimental projects that work effectively, serve people well, and reflect my values.

I have a lot of opinions about the role of technology in peoples' lives and I am ready to build what I want to see in the world! ðŸ’ª

I am friendly but not always very social, please feel free to drop me a line. Thanks!
